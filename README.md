## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Docker image layer management and multi-architecture deployment strategies. Through hands-on implementation, I explore Docker's sophisticated layer sharing mechanisms, digest-based image management, and cross-platform compatibility features. The project serves as both a learning journey and a practical reference for enterprise-grade Docker deployments.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Master Docker's layer architecture and optimization techniques
- Implement secure, digest-based image management workflows
- Configure and manage multi-architecture image deployments
- Optimize storage through intelligent layer sharing
- Create production-ready Docker deployment patterns
